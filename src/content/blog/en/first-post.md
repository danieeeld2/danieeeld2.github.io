# My first post: why I'm starting a blog

I've been wanting to have my own space to share what I learn, what I think, and what interests me. Not just as a professional portfolio, but as a technical and personal journal.

## Why now?

After finishing my double degree and starting to work as a Data Engineer, I realized that documenting what I learn helps me understand it better. And if it can also help someone else, even better.

## What do I plan to write about?

- Tutorials and guides on data and DevOps tools
- Reflections on my career path
- Personal projects and what I learn from them
- Experiences of living and working in different places

## And yes, also mathematics

One of the things I love most about having studied Mathematics is being able to express ideas precisely. For example, Euler's formula:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

Or something more practical, like the logistic regression loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]$$

This blog supports LaTeX formulas, so I can write about statistics and machine learning without limitations.

Welcome to this new space!
